# Security Fixes Applied

This document outlines the security improvements made to resolve the "Dangerous site" warning on Chrome.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Security Headers**
- Added `helmet` middleware for comprehensive security headers
- Implemented Content Security Policy (CSP) with proper directives
- Added X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, and X-XSS-Protection headers

### 2. **HTTPS Enforcement**
- Added automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirect in production
- Configured secure cookies for production environment
- Set `trust proxy` for Render deployment

### 3. **Session Security**
- Enabled secure cookies in production (`secure: true`)
- Configured proper SameSite settings for cross-origin requests
- Maintained httpOnly flag for XSS protection

### 4. **Mixed Content Prevention**
- Updated OpenStreetMap attribution link from HTTP to HTTPS
- Added upgrade-insecure-requests directive
- Ensured all external resources use HTTPS

### 5. **Deployment Configuration**
- Added proper Render configuration (`render.yaml`)
- Updated port configuration to use environment variable
- Added proper start script in package.json

## Dependencies Added
- `helmet`: ^7.1.0 - Security headers middleware
- `cors`: ^2.8.5 - CORS configuration

## Environment Variables Required
Make sure these are set in your Render dashboard:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `SECRET` (your session secret)
- `ATLASDB_URL` (MongoDB connection string)
- Other app-specific variables (Cloudinary, Map tokens, etc.)

## Deployment Notes
1. Redeploy your application on Render
2. Ensure all environment variables are properly set
3. The application will now automatically redirect HTTP to HTTPS
4. Security headers will be applied to all responses

The security warning should be resolved after redeployment with these fixes.
